# parkhoppr

The goal of parkhoppr is to allow access to Disney World wait times.

## Installation

You can install parkhoppr from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LucyMcGowan/parkhoppr")
```

## Example

There is currently just one function - you can get wait times for rides at Magic Kingdom. More to come very soon!

```{r example}
library("parkhoppr")
get_wait_times()
```
